# A terminator game built for the DE1-SoC (ECE244 final)

Description

Terminator  is a game that tests the players accuracy, patience, and tactical skills. As standard amongst many games, the keys used to move around are ‘w’ to move up, ‘a’ to move left, ‘s’ to move down and ‘d’ to move right. It should be noted that the cursor used to aim does not enable diagonal movements.

Rules

The rules are simple: shoot down the robots or risk losing a life if shot. The game ends when you have successfully been hit 5 times by the robots. There are a total of 8 levels, no one is expected to make it through till the end of the game. The player advances to the next level when they have killed all of the robots from that level. The lives for this game are persistent, in other words lives aren’t refreshed as you move up levels.

Operating using CPulator

Once the program is opened on CPulator and compiled the visuals will be displayed in the VGA display present on the right panel. The user inputs keystrokes via the PS/2 keyboard or mouse module. For a more immersive experience, it is recommended that the VGA display is scaled to 1 and shown in a separate box (available when the arrow on the left top corner of the VGA display is clicked).
